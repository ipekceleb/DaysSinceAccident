# DaysSinceAccident

A lightweight Rainmeter skin designed to visually display the number of accident-free days in the workplace.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as part of internal workplace safety improvement efforts under the **HSE-S (Health, Safety, Environment – Safety)** framework.

It addresses the need for a clear, visible, and easy-to-update counter showing how many days have passed since the last recorded incident.  
By using a custom background and clean layout, it supports visual management practices and promotes daily safety awareness on-site.
